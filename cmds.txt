#nextjs

* it is used to make full stack applications
all the components which we export default run on backend side and not on frontend which is different then react.
due to this less js code for client side.
only the html return is send to client side thus great for SEO. thus we can inspact the page and will be able to see the html code
thus we need to use 'use client' so that the log you added in the export function is avaible in the client size.

* page.tsx ,layout.tsx, not-found.tsx, error.tsx, loading.tsx, route.tsx are reservered file names.
page.tsx acts are index file for the folder to provide entry point for the route.
layout.tsx file follows the hirerchay we can have nexted layouts and an layout file has a scope of parent folder.
not-found.tsx Fallback page for "Not Found" errors (thrown by sibling or nested pages or layouts)
error.tsx  Fallback page for other errors (thrown by sibling pages or nested pages or layouts)
loading.tsx Fallback page which is shown whilst sibling or nested pages (or layouts) are fetching data
route.tsx Allows you to create an API route (i.e., a page which does NOT return JSX code but instead data, e.g., in the JSON format)

* next/link , next/image
<Link href="wfwfwfwf" /> doesn't make a request to server
<Image src="wefwnfwonh" width={} height={}> lazy loads the image, also adds srcset to pick the best image,fill can be used instead of width and height for auto space taking

* import type { Metadata } from "next"
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};
<head></head>
export const metadata (reserved keyword)

* app/icon.png will automatically be applied as page icon

* routing
folder structure represents routing, routeName/page.tsx the starting point for the route

* component
just make a file and export function init.
then import where you want as a tag.

* we can use @ to refer to root folder. this is done by default in tsconfig.json file

* [slug] (folder) to create a vaible name folder used to passing id's. if we have a [folder] and a folder with same name entered by client then that folder will take the presidance 

* export default function anything({param,children}){}
param for getting the [id] enter by client
getting the contents for child folder(child routes or pages)

* styling
by default nextjs uses tailwind
a css file can be imported by 'import "./globals.css";' any where and will be available everywhere
'import sty from anyname.module.css' now will be used by className={sty.classname} this is add a random generated name so that it's unique and applies only once

* next/navigation
import {usePathname} from 'next/navigation'; to give name current path 

import { Suspense } from "react";
Suspense is used for components what might need some time,
<Suspense fallback={<p>Fetching products...</p>}>   //fallback will be shown untill latestproducts tag is compelete executing
<LatestProducts />    //contains fetch request
</Suspense>

# sql db
